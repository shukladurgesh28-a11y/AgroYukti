# 🌿 AgroYukti: AI-Powered Smart Farming & Marketplace System

Welcome to AgroYukti, a smart agriculture platform that leverages **AI/ML**, **Deep Learning**, and **Blockchain** to empower farmers with real-time insights, automate crop health monitoring, and provide transparent crop transactions.


---

## 🌾 Project Overview

AgroYukti is a full-stack system built for smart farming and crop traceability. It brings together:

- 🌿 AI-based **Plant Disease Detection** via images
- 📈 **Crop Price Prediction** based on historical data
- 🌦️ **Weather Forecasting & Alerts**
- 🌱 **Soil Quality Prediction**
- 🔗 **Blockchain Marketplace** for transparent crop transactions
- 🎨 A modern, user-friendly **React-based UI**

Farmers can make better decisions, detect diseases early, forecast crop prices, and sell safely using blockchain-backed records.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🧠 AI + ML Models
- **Plant Disease Detection**: Deep learning model (EfficientNetB4) classifies leaf diseases using uploaded images.
- **Price Prediction**: Machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) trained on crop price data.
- **Weather Forecasting**: Uses time-series ML models to predict upcoming weather patterns.
- **Soil Quality Detection**: Classifies soil type using trained models based on NPK values and other soil parameters.

### 🔗 Blockchain Integration
- A smart contract (Solidity) enables **secure and transparent transactions** for crop selling.
- Farmers and buyers interact via a React UI, with Web3.js handling the contract calls.
- Transactions are stored on the **Ethereum** testnet (Ganache/Truffle), ensuring trust.

### 🌐 Frontend Interface
- Built using **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
- Farmers can:
  - Upload plant images
  - View predicted prices and weather alerts
  - See crop requests
  - List items for sale on the blockchain marketplace
